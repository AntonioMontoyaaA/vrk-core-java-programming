# SOLID Principles in Java


* Robert C. Martin gave five objected oriented design principles, and the acronym S.O.L.I.D is used for it. 
* Each letter of this acronym talks about principles in Java. 
* When you use all the principles of S.O.L.I.D in a combined manner, it becomes easier for you to develop software that can be managed easily. 
* The other features of using S.O.L.I.D are:

* **It avoids code smells**
* **Quickly refractor code**
* **Can do adaptive or agile software development** 

* **When you use the principle of S.O.L.I.D in your coding, you start writing the code that is both efficient and effective.**

#### What is the meaning of S.O.L.I.D?

* As stated above, S.O.L.I.D represents five principles of Java which are:

* **1) S: Single responsibility principle**
* **2) O: Open-closed principle**
* **3) L: Liskov substitution principle**
* **4) I: Interface segregation principle**
* **5) D: Dependency inversion principle**
