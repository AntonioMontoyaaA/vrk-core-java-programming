#### 1) Java 8 Lambda Expressions with examples

* **Lambda expression** is a new feature which is introduced in Java 8. A lambda expression is an anonymous function. A function that doesn’t have a name and doesn’t belong to any class. The concept of lambda expression was first introduced in LISP programming language.

* Java Lambda Expression Syntax
* To create a lambda expression, we specify input parameters (if there are any) on the left side of the lambda operator ->, and place the expression or block of statements on the right side of lambda operator. For example, the lambda expression (x, y) -> x + y specifies that lambda expression takes two arguments x and y and returns the sum of these.

(parameter_list) -> {function_body}
